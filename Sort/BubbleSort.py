# Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in
# which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.
# This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case
# complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
